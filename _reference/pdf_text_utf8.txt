Task Assignment: AI Mock Interview Platform 
 Overview 
Develop an AI-powered Mock Interview system designed to simulate real-world interview 
scenarios. The platform should help users practice and improve their interview performance 
through intelligent evaluation and instant feedback. 
This feature will be a key value addition to our product and must be designed with 
scalability and accuracy in mind. 
 
 Objectives 
• Simulate realistic interview environments 
• Provide intelligent, actionable feedback 
• Help users improve confidence, communication, and technical skills 
 
 Core Functionalities 
 Interview Types 
The system should support the following interview formats: 
• HR Interviews 
• Technical Interviews 
• Managerial / Behavioural Interviews 
 
 Interaction Modes 
Users should be able to take interviews using:
